# ME 539 -  Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning


This is the handout and homework repository for the course "ME 539 Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning" which will be taught (Fall 2021) by Prof. [Ilias Bilionis](https://www.predictivesciencelab.org/authors/ebilionis/) at Purdue University.
The course is fully online with the videos being accessible through [EdX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PurdueX+ME597x+2T2020/course/).

This course evolved from the ME 597 "Data Analytics for Scientists and Engineeers" taught two times by Prof. Bilionis, and the ME 597/MA 598 "Introduction to Uncertainty Quantification" taught three times by Prof. Bilionis (the first time, Spring 2016 it was co-taught with Prof. Guang Lin).
If you are interested in accessing the old versions of the course, they can be found [here](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/uq-course).
Note, that there is also a, 1-credit, undergraduate version of the course under the name ME 297 "Introduction to Data Science for Mechanical Engineers." This version can be found [here](https://github.com/PurdueMechanicalEngineering/me-297-intro-to-data-science).
Also, note that the course is about to obtain a permanent number in Spring 2022 and be renamed to "Introduction to Scientific Machine Learning."

## Running the notebooks on Google Colab

Make sure you have a Google account before you start.
Then, you just click on the links above.

## Converting your homework notebooks to PDF on Google Colab

One solution is to "print" your notebook to a PDF.
However, we have observed that sometimes the figures get a bit messed up.
One solution is to run the notebooks on your own laptop, and the do "File-> Download as-> PDF via Latex (.pdf)."
See below if you want to take that route.
Now, it is possible to do the same thing on Google Colab.
Follow the instructions in [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PredictiveScienceLab/data-analytics-se/blob/master/activities/notebook_conversion.ipynb).

## Running the notebooks on your personal computer

Find and download the right version of
[Anaconda for Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution) from Continuum Analytics.
This package contains most of the software we are going to need.
**Note:** You do need Python 3 and note Python 2. The notebooks will not work
with Python 2.

### OS Specific Instructions

#### Microsoft Windows

+ We need C, C++, Fortran compilers, as well as the Python sources.
Start the command line by opening "Anaconda Prompt" from the
start menu. In the command line type:
```
conda config --append channels https://repo.continuum.io/pkgs/free
conda install mingw libpython
```
+ Finally, you need [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). As you install it,
make sure to indicate that you want to use "Git from the command line and
also from 3rd party software".

#### Apple OS X

+ Download and install the latest version of [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/).

#### Linux

If you are using Linux, I am sure that you can figure it out on your own.

### Installation of Required Python Packages

Independently of the operating system, use the command line to install the following Python packages:
+ [Seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/), for beautiful graphics:
```
conda install seaborn
```

+ [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) for MCMC sampling:
```
conda install pymc3
```

+ [GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) for Gaussian process regression:
```
pip install GPy
```

+ [pydoe](https://pythonhosted.org/pyDOE/randomized.html) for generating experimental designs:
```
pip install pydoe
```

+ [fipy](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/) for solving partial differential equations using the finite volume method:
```
pip install fipy
```
*** Windows Users ***

You may receive the error
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'future'
```
If so, please install future and then install fipy:
```
pip install future
```

+ [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for some standard machine learning algorithms implemented in Python:
```
conda install scikit-learn
```

+ [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) for visualizing probabilistic graphical models:
```
pip install graphviz
```

### Running the notebooks

+ Open the command line.
+ `cd` to your favorite folder.
+ Then, type:
```
git clone https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/data-analytics-se.git
```
+ This will download the contents of this repository in a folder called `data-analytics-se`.
+ Enter the ``data-analytics-se`` folder:
```
cd data-analytics-se
```
+ Start the jupyter notebook by typing the command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
+ Use the browser to navigate the course, experiment with code etc.
+ If the course content has been updated, type the following command (while being inside `data-analytics-se`) to get the latest version:
```
git pull origin master
```
Keep in mind, that if you have made local changes to the repository, you may have to commit them before moving on.
