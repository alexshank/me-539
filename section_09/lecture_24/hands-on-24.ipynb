    "It will always do this when you are training networks by just minimizing a loss function.\n",
    "What happens is that the algorithm, by paying more attention to minimizing the training loss it will start, eventually, overfitting the training data and it will not be able to generalize correctly for the test data.\n",
    "There are ways around this. We are going to learn about the basic one in the next lecture (*weight regularization* and *early stopping*).\n",
    "There are some advanced ways to avoid overfitting (e.g., *dropout*, *Bayesian neural networks*) which we are not going to cover in the class."
