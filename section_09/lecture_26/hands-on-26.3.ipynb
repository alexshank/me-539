    "\n",
    "In this hands-on activity we implement the method of [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2019.109120) to solve high-dimensional elliptic PDEs in PyTorch.\n",
    "The original implementation is in TensorFlow and can be found in [this](https://github.com/PredictiveScienceLab/variational-elliptic-SPDE) github repository.\n",
    "However, we solve slightly different problems from the paper.\n",
    "This is because we do not want to go through the trouble of introducing the details of the random fields of the paper.\n",
    "Also, note that it is not our intention to provide code that is 100% functional.\n",
    "This is highly nontrivial.\n",
    "The code below takes a lot of time to run (~5 hours) and it does not always produce a sufficiently converged network that solves the stochastic PDE.\n",
    "To fix this, one would have to experiment with the network structure and the details of the optimization algorithm.\n",
    "So, consider what follows as an example of how you would begin your journey into physics-informed NN for UQ - not as the end.\n",
    "If you are interested in a complete example that works, visit our github repository and run our code there."
